Group Leader
<p> Lucas has over a decade's experience in computing the properties of many-body quantum systems from first principles. He is the primary architect and developer of the open-source quantum Monte Carlo program QWalk, and has made advances in many-body quantum methods, as well as a number of applications to challenging electronic systems. While he has many interests, the overarching theme of his research is using computers to study systems of electrons that fall beyond the normal paradigms of metals and insulators. </p>

<td> <span id="bioname"> <b> Hitesh Changlani </b> </span>  <br>
Postdoc
<p> Hitesh hails from Cornell and specializes in many-body quantum methods, mostly as applied to model lattice systems. His work in this group has focused on formalizing the link between the high energy (for condensed matter) physics of electrons and the low-energy qualitative descriptions that we use to talk about materials. Hitesh is a prolific collaborator and also worked with Shinsei Ryu, Taylor Hughes, Bryan Clark, and David Ceperley in the physics department at UIUC. He is now a postdoc at Johns Hopkins.
